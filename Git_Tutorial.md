# Git Tutorial 

Note that this assumes you have python and a code editor (Eg. vscode downloaded) 

## Downloading Git 
First you will need to download Git onto your computer... 
You can do so through this [Git Download Link](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Configuring Git 
After installing Git onto your computer, you will need to configure it with your name and email address
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```
Replace "Your Name" with your name and "your_email@example.com" with your email address.

## Initializing a Git Repository
To start version controlling your project, navigate to your project's directory (folder) using the terminal and run:
```
git init
```
This creates a new Git repository in your project directory.
